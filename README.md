# local-library-project

# Summary
This was an assignment that required me to build an application that wuold help a local library know whether a book was checked out, who checked it out last, and a list of popular books based on those parameters.

# Application
I used JavaScript exclusively for this project, as the HTML and CSS were pre built for this assignment.

# Challenges
With this being one of the first JavaScript oriented project for me, the challenge was to get my functions to function properly and return the correct form of nformation. I ran into som eerrors where I was not calling the right objects, and returning empty arrays.
